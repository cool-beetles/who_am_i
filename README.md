# who_am_i

This project is a teaching project.

Your task is to create simple HTML page about yourself. You can do whatever you want in terms of design but at minimum, this page should contain:

- your Github username with link
- your picture
- list of your skills

**IMPORTANT** the name of your repository should be _<your_username>_.github.io because you want it to be deployed to Github pages https://pages.github.com/, so everybody can see it!
